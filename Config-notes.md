`pyproject.toml` Configuration File Notes
=========================================

The _Python Packaging User Guide_ section ["Writing your
`pyproject.toml`"][ppug-conf] covers much of the information that can go
into that file, some of which is directly used/displayed on your PyPI
package page.

In particular, you will almost invariably want several of the [`urls.*`]
entries so that people can find the source code and other sites related to
your project.

### Classifiers
